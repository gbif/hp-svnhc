# What data can be found here
The data accessible on this hosted portal has been **provided by the [swiss natural history institutions](https://svnhc.hp.gbif-staging.org/institution/search)** and is **hosted on [GBIF.org](https://www.gbif.org/)**.

# How is the data displayed on the SVNHC portal?
The data present on the SVNHC portal is found on this page Occurrence search - SVNHC (home > Data > Occurrence or Collections or Institutions). The display can be chosen:
- a **table** where each line corresponds to a museum specimen (or a collection or an institution , depending on the view chosen) and each column corresponds to **all the information we have about a specific specimen/collection/institution**.
- a **map** where each point corresponds to a **georeferenced museum specimen**. By clicking on it on the map, a small window opens, and by clicking on the small window, the information panel of the occurrence appears on the right of the screen.
