# The general format for these compositions is a list of blocks. Each block has a type and some data that is used by the block template.
# See more examples at https://hp-theme.gbif-staging.org/layout/compose
composition:
- type: heroImage # The type is a template. In this case  a big splashy image with some text on it. The data defines what the image is and what the text is.
