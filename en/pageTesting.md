# Upload my data
1. Go to the Data Aggregator website.
| - You can change the language of the website on the top right corner of the window (Available languages: English, Fran√ßais, Deutsch). At the moment, only English and Deutsch are available. | <img src="/assets/gif/20240807_LanguagesChange.gif" width="300" height="300" /> |
2. Click on Collections on the left side of the window.
- On this page, you can see all the collections that have already been uploaded in the Data Aggregator. The names of the collections are based on the GrSciColl collection names.
- You can order the collection list by clicking on the column titles (e.g. Name, Code, Progress, Records count/est., and Updated At). By clicking twice or more, you can order it in an ascending or descending order.
- If you want to update an existing collection, go directly to step 4.
- If you want to create a new collection that is not yet on this page, go to the next step.

3. Click on **New collection** on the right side of the window.
  1. Select the type of your data. ‚ö†Ô∏è**Mandatory**‚ö†Ô∏è
    - Available types: Zoology, Botany, Geology, Paleontology
  2. Select the corresponding GrSciColl Collection of your institution. ‚ö†Ô∏è**Mandatory**‚ö†Ô∏è
    - If the GrSciColl collection has already been used in another upload, it is not present anymore on the drop-down list of this window. You can find it on the Collections page (see step 2.).
    - You can filter the suggested collections by writing your institution code (e.g. G, BERN, NMLU, etc.). This reduces the suggested list to only your registered collections.
  3. Add a description of the collection. üí°optionalüí°
  4. Click on **Create collection**
    - If not ordered (see step 2., second sublist item), your newly created collection is added at the end of the list. If you want to find it quickly, you may click on the column titel **Updated at** and order it in a descending order (Newest to Latest).

4. Click on the collection name.

  1. If your collection is empty, click either on the **+ Import** button in the center of the page, or the **Import dataset** button in the top-right corner (it does the same thing at this point).
  2. If your collection already has records and you want to add new records or update the existing ones, click on the **Import dataset** button in the top-right corner.
