# Tutorials -How to use
The Data Aggregator has a procedure separated in four important parts:
1. Preparation of the dataset before the upload
2. Upload of the dataset either as a new collection or to update an already imported dataset
3. Mapping of the dataset field names with the Data Aggregator's Darwin Core-based fields
4. Encoding of the dataset
5. Validation of the dataset
6. Publication of the dataset


## Darwin Core Mapping
[Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) is a **data standard**, a template to be used when organising data in a database or a table in order to have distinct and **precise fields with a known and fixed information format** in each of them. It has been created as a helping basis to make [FAIR](https://dwc.tdwg.org/ ) data.

The direct benefit of the Darwin Core standard is the **high level of compatibility between data from different sources**.
