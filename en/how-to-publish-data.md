In order to publish your dataset/collection on the SVNHC portal, you need to first prepare a .tsv file (Tab-separated values file) with your data (see [Prepare my date](#prepare-my-data) and upload it in the [Data Aggregator website](https://staging.aggregator.scnat.zebbra.ch/). After the [mapping](#darwin-core-mapping) and [encoding](#encode-my-data) of your data, the dataset/collection is ready to be [published on GBIF.org](#publish-my-data). From there, it will be displayed on the SVNHC portal, in the [Occurrence data section](https://svnhc.hp.gbif-staging.org/occurrence/search).

# Checklist -to do before starting the Data Aggregator
- [x] TSV file of my dataset with Darwin Core standardised columns and cell content. --> [I need help with that](https://svnhc.hp.gbif-staging.org/en/data-aggregator,md##do-i-have to-upload-my-entire-database-fields-into-the-data-aggregator)
1. Preparation of the dataset before the upload
2. Upload of the dataset either as a new collection or to update an already imported dataset
3. Mapping of the dataset field names with the Data Aggregator's Darwin Core-based fields
4. Encoding of the dataset
5. Validation of the dataset
6. Publication of the dataset


# Prepare my data
The data has to correspond to the Darwin Core format

# Darwin Core Mapping
[Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) is a **data standard**, a template to be used when organising data in a database or a table in order to have distinct and **precise fields with a known and fixed information format** in each of them. It has been created as a helping basis to make [FAIR](https://dwc.tdwg.org/ ) data.

The direct benefit of the Darwin Core standard is the **high level of compatibility between data from different sources**.
