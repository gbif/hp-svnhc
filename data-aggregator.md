## Swiss Data Aggregator

More than 90% of the specimens curated in Switzerland are biological or paleontological. For the aggregation and publication of digital information on these specimens, SwissCollNet will collaborate with InfoSpecies and build on the already existing data infrastructure of the Swiss node of GBIF.

InfoSpecies is the umbrella organisation of the national data centers and coordination offices for species promotion. One of the main goals of InfoSpecies is the provision, management and diffusion of species records, which includes natural history collection data.

The long-term objective is to achieve automatised data transfer of collection data to the national aggregator and publication of data on national and international online portals as well as an automatised update of data records.
