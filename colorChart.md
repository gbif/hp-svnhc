# Bases elements of the hosted portals (_config.yml)
[_config.yml](https://github.com/gbif/hp-svnhc/blob/master/_config.yml)
- primary = "#fa5e97"
  - buttons
  - links
- links = default (same as primary)

In order to maintain a consistency in colors and hues, a yml file ([_data/colors.yml](https://github.com/gbif/hp-svnhc/blob/master/_data/colors.yml)) has been created and contains the colors information used in the hosted portal)
