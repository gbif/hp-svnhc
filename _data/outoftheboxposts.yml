      Here are two herbarium sheets (Sheet-0059884 and Sheet-0059885) of the [BERN Herbarium](https://www.boga.unibe.ch/wissenschaft/herbarium/index_ger.html){:target="_blank"}. Same species, _Orchis traunsteineri_ currently named [_Dactylorhiza traunsteineri (Rchb.) So√≥_](https://www.infoflora.ch/en/flora/dactylorhiza-traunsteineri.html){:target="_blank"}, same collector, only 1 year gap (1972 for the one on the left, 1971 for the one on the right).  The original colour of the flowers is a bright purple red. This colour can still be seen on the recent sheet in contrast with the brown color older one, which is only 1 year older. This difference could be due to the treatment the plant received after being collected and before being mounted. However, the BERN Herbarium does not have any records about these two specimens that could explain such a difference in conservation state. Writing down as much information as possible when collecting and preparing the specimens is crucial, or else important information can be lost.
